# Masonry / BrickLayer 2.0 — Roadmap

**Masonry** is a research-first orchestration layer for Claude Code combining the BrickLayer 2.0
autoresearch campaign system with full development workflow: planning, building, verification,
code review, security audit, and UI composition. BrickLayer is the research engine underneath —
a universal autonomous framework for mapping failure boundaries in any system.

The human defines what matters. Masonry asks the questions, runs the experiments, and reports
what it found.

## Phase 2 — Masonry Ecosystem Expansion ✅

All 9 tasks complete (shipped across two sessions, Mar 16 2026).

### Rich HUD + Execution Engines

| # | Item | Status |

---

## Phase 6 — Campaign Quality Intelligence 📋

Inspired by the NVIDIA Multi-Agent Intelligent Warehouse (MAIW) architecture (Mar 2026).
Goal: make BrickLayer's research loop self-aware about output quality, not just output volume.

**Rated benefit: 7/10.** Phases 1–5 built the engine and expanded reach. Phase 6 makes verdicts
trustworthy at scale — the difference between "we ran 200 questions" and "we ran 200 questions
and we know which ones we can trust." Most impactful when campaigns exceed a single wave.

### 6.01 — Verdict Confidence Tiers 📋

Replace binary verdicts with a confidence-weighted tier system.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.01a | Add `confidence: 0.0–1.0` field to finding frontmatter | 📋 |
| 6.01b | Add `needs_human: bool` flag — auto-set when confidence < 0.35 | 📋 |
| 6.01c | Kiln: render confidence as fill bar on finding cards | 📋 |
| 6.01d | Dashboard: filter INCONCLUSIVE by confidence band | 📋 |

### 6.02 — LLM-as-Judge (peer reviewer scoring) 📋

`peer-reviewer` currently appends CONFIRMED/CONCERNS/OVERRIDE but assigns no numeric quality
signal. Mortar treats all INCONCLUSIVEs identically regardless of review outcome.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.02a | Extend `peer-reviewer` to emit `quality_score: 0.0–1.0` in finding frontmatter | 📋 |
| 6.02b | Mortar: re-queue INCONCLUSIVE findings where quality_score < 0.4 with narrowed scope | 📋 |
| 6.02c | `question_weights.py`: incorporate quality_score into weight update formula | 📋 |

### 6.03 — Question Sharpening (feedback loop) 📋

hypothesis-generator currently only appends new questions. Low-confidence findings should
retroactively narrow *remaining PENDING questions* in the same domain.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.03a | `bl/question_sharpener.py` — reads PENDING questions + recent INCONCLUSIVE findings, rewrites scope | 📋 |
| 6.03b | Wave synthesizer calls sharpener before writing synthesis.md | 📋 |
| 6.03c | Dashboard: show "sharpened" badge on questions that were narrowed | 📋 |

### 6.04 — Shared Campaign Context Injection 📋

Each agent spawned by Mortar currently starts cold, re-reading findings/ and questions.md.
A `campaign-context.md` written at wave start would give all agents consistent shared state.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.04a | Mortar writes `campaign-context.md` at wave start: project summary + top 5 findings + open hypotheses | 📋 |
| 6.04b | All agent spawn prompts prepend campaign-context.md content | 📋 |
| 6.04c | campaign-context.md auto-refreshed after every 10 findings | 📋 |

### 6.05 — Agent Performance Time-Series 📋

`agent_db.json` stores static scores. No trend data — Kiln can't show if an agent is improving
or drifting. Needed for overseer to make meaningful rewrite decisions.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.05a | Extend `agent_db.json` schema: `runs: [{timestamp, verdict, duration_ms, quality_score}]` | 📋 |
| 6.05b | Kiln: verdict accuracy sparkline per agent (last 20 runs) | 📋 |
| 6.05c | `agent-auditor`: flag agents with declining accuracy trend (last 5 vs prior 5) | 📋 |

### 6.06 — MCP Tool Manifest 📋

Each agent declares its own tool access independently. Tool descriptions drift. New tools added
to MCP aren't surfaced to existing agents.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.06a | `template/.claude/agents/tools-manifest.md` — canonical tool list with descriptions | 📋 |
| 6.06b | Agent frontmatter: `tools: [recall, simulate, filesystem]` declaration | 📋 |
| 6.06c | `forge-check` validates agents aren't missing tool declarations | 📋 |

---

## Phase 10 — FastMCP 3.1 Python MCP Tools 💡

**Goal**: Use FastMCP 3.1 (Python) to build new Masonry MCP tools in Python rather than extending
`masonry-mcp.js`. The existing Node.js server stays unchanged — new tools are additive.

**Motivation**: masonry-mcp.js is working but is a maintenance burden in a Python-first project.
FastMCP 3.1 adds composable server mounting (`namespace=`) and `FastMCPOpenAPI` — wrap any REST
API as MCP tools with zero boilerplate. In-process transport enables proper unit testing.

**Candidate new tools** (Python-native, no equivalent in masonry-mcp.js):
- `masonry_karen` — invoke karen agent tasks (init-docs, update-changelog, audit-folder) from MCP
- `masonry_retrospective` — trigger retrospective analysis and return structured findings
- `masonry_registry` — query/rebuild registry.json, list agents with scores from agent_db.json
- `masonry_retro_apply` — read retro-actions.md and generate a spec for /build

**Architecture**: FastMCP 3.1 server at `masonry/src/mcp_python/server.py`, registered separately
in `~/.claude.json`. Does NOT replace masonry-mcp.js — both run in parallel.

**Prerequisite**: `pip install fastmcp>=3.1.0`

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 10.01 | `masonry/src/mcp_python/server.py` — FastMCP 3.1 server skeleton | 💡 |
| 10.02 | `masonry_karen` tool — wraps karen agent task modes | 💡 |
| 10.03 | `masonry_retrospective` tool — post-campaign quality report | 💡 |
| 10.04 | `masonry_registry` tool — agent catalog queries | 💡 |
| 10.05 | Register in `~/.claude.json` alongside masonry-mcp.js | 💡 |
| 10.06 | In-process tests via FastMCP test transport | 💡 |

## Design Principles

1. **Universal verdict envelope.** Every runner, every target, every question type produces the same `{verdict, summary, data, details}` shape.
2. **Questions are the product.** The question bank has compounding value. A good question asked 100 times across 100 projects is worth more than 100 one-off tests.
3. **Humans set goals, agents set questions.** The human knows what matters. The agent knows what to ask technically.
4. **Verdicts must be falsifiable.** HEALTHY requires specific evidence. FAILURE requires a reproduction path.
5. **Cheap at scale beats thorough occasionally.** 500 fast questions overnight finds more than 5 exhaustive questions quarterly.
6. **Failure boundaries, not pass/fail.** The goal is not "does it work?" — it's "where does it stop working?"
7. **Lightest path that preserves quality.** Direct action for trivial tasks, agents for substantive work.
