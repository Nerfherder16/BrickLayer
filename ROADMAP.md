# Masonry / BrickLayer 2.0 — Roadmap

**Masonry** is a research-first orchestration layer for Claude Code combining the BrickLayer 2.0
autoresearch campaign system with full development workflow: planning, building, verification,
code review, security audit, and UI composition. BrickLayer is the research engine underneath —
a universal autonomous framework for mapping failure boundaries in any system.

The human defines what matters. Masonry asks the questions, runs the experiments, and reports
what it found.

## Design Principles

1. **Universal verdict envelope.** Every runner, every target, every question type produces the same `{verdict, summary, data, details}` shape.
2. **Questions are the product.** The question bank has compounding value. A good question asked 100 times across 100 projects is worth more than 100 one-off tests.
3. **Humans set goals, agents set questions.** The human knows what matters. The agent knows what to ask technically.
4. **Verdicts must be falsifiable.** HEALTHY requires specific evidence. FAILURE requires a reproduction path.
5. **Cheap at scale beats thorough occasionally.** 500 fast questions overnight finds more than 5 exhaustive questions quarterly.
6. **Failure boundaries, not pass/fail.** The goal is not "does it work?" — it's "where does it stop working?"
7. **Lightest path that preserves quality.** Direct action for trivial tasks, agents for substantive work.
